# 🐝 CS1332 - Data Structures and Algorithms w/ HB
## AT GEORGIA TECH (2023)!

## Why Does This Exist?
Ever had trouble pulling together your Homeworks to study the Exam Coding Questions? What about accidental deletion? Maybe you implemented a method and found it was too complex? Well, This is the right place for you! This repository has everything you will ever need when it comes to CS 1332 @ Georgia Tech.

## How to Use?
Each package listed in the repo is a homework during the spring semester. As stated by the professor, any question from the homework **IS** Fair game for the Coding Section of exams. I have added each of my implementations to the repository for the homeworks. If you notice an error, PLEASE open an issue or go edit it yourself and I will accept pull/push requests.

### BUT I AM STUDYING EFFICIENCY???? WHERE? HOW?
I will try to keep an updated list of EACH FUNCTION'S EFFICIENCY in each folder.



> NOTE! Please for the love of God Obey Georgia Tech Honor Code and All College of Computing Regulation.
> THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT FOR YOUR BENEFIT ON HOMEWORK! ONLY VIEW THIS BEFORE EXAMS, AFTER, ETC. THERE IS A REASON I COMMIT TO THE REPO A WEEK AFTER THE LATE DEADLINE.

Another Note: I try to delete the PDFs sent out in each homework to abide by GT IP. I may not catch them all, or too busy to delete before pushing. If you notice a few, please shoot me a message at my socials.
